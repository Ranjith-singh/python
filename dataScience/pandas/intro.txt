pandas is mainly used for performing ETL ops on the data
it can be used to read/write to a file
pandas mainly operate with data in 2 types
    Series: for 1 dimensional data
    DataFrame: for 2 dimensional data
pandas consist of various methods for:
    Date_range("YYYY/MM/DD"), concat(), cut(), group(), Series() and DataFrame()
numpy:
    numpy helps in converting data to array types
    it helps to performing various agg operations like:
        count(), sum(), mean(), min(), max()
    it also helps in extraction of index/rows and columns
rows are also known as indices/index
Date_range:
    takes particular date in "YYYY/MM/DD" and periods as args
    can also specify freq of increments for periods
pd.Series-s:
    similar to 1D array
    form Series from list, array, Date_range and basically any 1D sequence
    also takes index and dtype as arg
    by default dtype: object
    assigning of values can be done using iloc: takes index, loc: takes index values
    Series.value-counts()
    s.str: can perform any of the std string methods

both loc and iloc :
    takespositions as arg in case of Series/DataFrame
    in takes list arg only in case of 1D/Series obj

pd.DataFrame-df:
    similar to 2D array
    takes 2D data/sequence
    when you extract a particular row/column from DataFrame it becomes a pd.Series
    can be provided using numpy.random lib: randn(1,2), randint(0,9,(1,2))
        in the form of a dict: {}
            while passing as dict size() should be = other Series or 1
    it consist of index/rows and columns which can be passed as args
    you can use range() to provide continuous values following a pattern
    head() and tail() to fetch data to a limit from above/below
    various fields and methods such as df.index, df.columns, df.to_numpy()
    df.describe():
        result of agg func's on the DataFrame according to columns
    df.T: transpose
    sort_index(axis=0:index 1:col, ascending:Boolean): sort based on the index/column values
    sort_values(by="B"): values in particular column
    df["A"]: provide Series of values in col A
        the Series obtained is a list so we can perform ops like slice(), reverse() etc [::]
        it can also be done on index values
    use loc[] and iloc[] to extract DataFrame, Series or values from existing DataFrame
    df[df["A"]>0]: extract DataFrame from existing DataFrame using conditions statements
    copy(): value copy, deep_copy(): reference copy
    df["E"]=[]: add values to existing column or creates new column
    df["E"].isin(): multiple = statements
        reverse using ~ or ==False after equation
    based on conditions we can perform different operations
    dropna(how=any): if 1 column val is null entire row deleted, fillna(value=5)
    isna(): return Boolean for each val
    Series.shift(2): move values forward
    df.sub(): subtract Series values from each column
    df.agg(lambda x: np.mean(x)*5.3) and df.transform():each element
    break DataFrame using [] and join using pd.concat()
    pd.merge(df1, df2, on="key"): similar to join in sql
    df.groupby("A")["C","D"].sum(): similar to sql groupby C and D columns should be summed
    specify multiIndex using pd.multiIndex: for 2D arrays
    stack(): increase groupby or column to index
    unstack(index): decrease groupby based on index
    pd.pivot_table():
        making pivot_table form DataFrame
        specify arg columns, index and values for pivot_table within the DataFrame columns
    ts.resample("1Min").sum(): groupby index based on resample size
    tz_localize(): local time zone and tz_convert(): from local time zone to another time zone
    +pd.offsetBusinessDays(5): adds 5 days + weekends to existing Date_range
    provide category column to specific column using .astype():
        .cat. to rename and set category: adds new category
        can also sort_values(by=category)

matplotlib.pyplot:
    using DataFrame.plot() and Series.plot() to plot diff graphs
    use cumsum(), plt.figure(), plt.legend() to make graphs cleaner


use pd.to_csv/to_excel: to write to a file
use pd.read_csv/excel: to read from a file, also use args like sheet_name and index_col
